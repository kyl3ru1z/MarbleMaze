# MarbleMaze
Marble Maze controlled using the Arduino UNO. The main objective of this game is to tilt the maze in certain directions to maneuver a marble across a maze. Achieved maze titling by mapping a 2-Axis Joystick to two micro servos. Added a feature where the user can time how long it takes for them to reach the end of the maze and rate how well they did.
